### Choice of Technologies

ðŸ’… **Styled Components:**

Styled Components is a library designed for React and React Native. It uses a blend of CSS and JavaScript through a technique called CSS-in-JS.

- Global Stylesheet
- Prop-based Adaptation
- Style Extension
- Theming

ðŸš¥ **Zustand:**

Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management solution. Its state management is centralized and action-based.

- Less repetitive code compared to Redux.
- Flexibility
- Doesn't require wrapping the application in a provider, as is typically done in Redux.
- Re-renders components only when changes occur.
